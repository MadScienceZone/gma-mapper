# Contributing to the GMA Mapper Project
This is a personal "labor of love" project for the author and a few of his friends who play TTRPG games together. However, if it is of interest to others they're welcome to use it as well.
If you see something you'd like to suggest as a new feature, feel free to add an issue which we'll consider and look into as time allows, with no guarantee that any action will necessarily be taken, or that our solution will be exactly what you had in mind, since this is totally on a spare-time best-effort basis and is subject to the whims of the main author as to what features should be included.
You are also welcome to submit a pull request to contribute new code, subject to the above caveats.

We'll keep things informal and light for now, until the day comes when we may need something more rigorously defined.

## Important Note About Future Developments
At the current time, a major effort is underway to rewrite the mapper in Go, refactoring all the old legacy code as we do so. This means we likely won't consider any major new features on the Tcl implementation, since they'd have to be re-implemented anyway in the new code.
